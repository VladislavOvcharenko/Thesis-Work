# Thesis-Work
All extra information that could not be put on the thesis like gifs.

##This is for the gifs

R=The current robust value
C=the multiple of 0.1'', where 2 signifies 2(0.1'')=0.2'' and so on
T=Threshold, where 3 is 3 times the rms noise
M= is the mask used, where there is Big (mask much larger radially to the disk), Medium and Small (mask nearly imitates the shape of the disk), had very little effect on the image 
Rob.gif is the gif that progressively changes the robust values from natural weighting scheme to uniform. 
Cellz.gif shows how changing the cell size effects the final image. There is some slight 
UVs.gif shows how changing from what UV values are used in the synthesis affects the final image, should be noted that 90 means 90 kilo lambda
UVs_maskless.gif similar to UVs.gif, but the assumption of the same mask used isn't there anymore
Tapers.gif shows what an ever increasing taper does to the final image
