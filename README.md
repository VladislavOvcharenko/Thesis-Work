All extra information that could not be put on the thesis like gifs.

###This is for the gifs###

R=The current robust value

C=the multiple of 0.1'', where 2 signifies 2(0.1'')=0.2'' and so on

T=Threshold, where 3 is 3 times the rms noise

M= is the mask used, where there is Big (mask much larger radially to the disk), Medium and Small (mask nearly imitates the shape of the disk), had very little effect on the image 

<a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/Rob.gif">Rob.gif</a> is the gif that progressively changes the robust values from natural weighting scheme to uniform.

<a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/Cellz.gif">Cellz.gif</a> shows how changing the cell size effects the final image. There is some slight 

<a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/UVs.gif">UVs.gif</a> shows how changing from what UV values are used in the synthesis affects the final image, should be noted that 90 means 90 kilo lambda

<a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/UVs_maskless.gif">UVs_maskless.gif</a> similar to <a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/UVs.gif">UVs.gif</a>, but the assumption of the same mask used isn't there anymore

<a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/Tapers.gif">Tapers.gif</a> shows what an ever increasing taper does to the dirty image

<a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/PA.gif">PA.gif</a> shows how incorrect position angles affect the UV plot

<a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/Incs.gif">Incs.gif</a> similarly shows how an incorrect inclination affects the UV plot

The triplet of gifs RobustX_3d.gif show a 3 dimensional representation of the usual pixelated image where X value is the robust values <a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/Robust0.5_3d.gif">0.5</a>, <a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/Robust1_3d.gif">1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/VladislavOvcharenko/Thesis-Work/blob/main/Robust2_3d.gif">2</a>
